🎨 Etch-a-Sketch (DOM Sketchpad)
This project is part of the Foundations Course by The Odin Project. The goal is to practice DOM manipulation and Flexbox by building an interactive sketchpad that behaves like an Etch-a-Sketch toy in the browser.

🚀 Features
Dynamically generated 16×16 grid of square <div> elements

Responsive grid built using Flexbox

Hover effect to "draw" on squares as you move your mouse

Clear & resize button that prompts the user to enter a new grid size (up to 100)

Grid resizes proportionally to keep the total size consistent

Fully built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🧠 What I Learned
Creating and appending DOM elements with JavaScript

Adding event listeners to multiple elements

Handling user input via prompt()

Building flexible layouts using Flexbox

Managing state and DOM resets dynamically

📸 Demo
Insert a screenshot or a link to a live demo here if hosted on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

🛠️ How It Works
A <button> sits above the grid asking the user for a new size.

Clicking the button triggers a prompt() asking for a number (max 100).

The script clears the old grid and creates a new one using that size.

Hovering over a square changes its background color to simulate drawing.

🔧 Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox)

JavaScript (Vanilla)

🧪 Extra Features (Optional Enhancements)
These are additional features that can be implemented for extra practice:

✅ Random RGB color on hover for each square

✅ Squares darken by 10% each time they’re hovered over (progressive shading)

✅ Opacity-based effect to simulate brush strength

📂 Project Setup
To run this project locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/etch-a-sketch.git
cd etch-a-sketch
open index.html
Or simply open index.html in your browser.

💡 Future Improvements
Use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox (once learned)

Add color picker to let users choose draw colors

Add erase and clear buttons

Add mobile/touch support
