A browser-based sketchpad built with JavaScript and Flexbox — inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

## 🚀 Features

- Grid built with **Flexbox**
- Hover over squares to "draw" with your mouse
- "Click Me" button lets users reset and resize the grid
- Responsive sizing to keep total grid area consistent
- Limit of 100 squares per side to avoid performance issues
